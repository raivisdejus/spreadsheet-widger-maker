# Spreadsheet widget maker #

This repo contains power-user friendly code to turn any spreadsheet (csv actually) into a widget. So to run it you will need:
* Read the rest of this document
* Change config values in code constants
* Compile the app or run the script (might need to do some Googling to prove you are true power-user) 

Some of use cases:
* Visualise data from your smart weather station, that was saved to Google Spreadsheet with help of IFTTT
* See the reminding budget or savings progress
* See how many free seats are left in an event where participants subsctibe via Google Forms
* _Please add you example here..._ 

## The data ##
To start you will need the data. You can start with the demo data:
* Progress on savings - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYI2d9Wt6jT781cL_yiJTkrAbZ1NSPf-eEWoDpGv7I4/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=SavingsProgress 

To prepare yout own data you have to share the Google Spreadsheet as a CSV. For more info take a look at [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33713084/download-link-for-google-spreadsheets-csv-export-with-multiple-sheets)
