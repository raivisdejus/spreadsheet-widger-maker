This repo contains power-user friendly code to turn any spreadsheet (csv actually) into a widget. So to run it you will need:
* Read some simple documentation
* Change config values in code constants
* Compile the app or run the script (might need to do some Googling to prove you are true power-user) 

Some of use cases:
* Visualise data from your smart weather station, that was saved to Google Spreadsheet with help of IFTTT
* See the reminding budget or savings progress
* See how many free seats are left in an event where participants subsctibe via Google Forms
* _Please add you example here..._
